# Software Engineering (2603-SEG2202) - Git & GitHub Guidance

## Introduction
Welcome to this supplementary guide for the Software Engineering (2603-SEG2202) course. This repository serves as a resource to familiarize yourself with Git and GitHub.

**Important Notes:**
*   **Supplementary & Optional:** This guide is entirely optional and extra. It is designed for students who wish to learn industry-standard version control tools.
*   **No Extra Marks:** Completing the steps here or using Git/GitHub for this course will **not** earn you any extra marks.
*   **Does NOT Replace eLearn:** This does **not** replace the official eLearn portal. You must still upload all your assignments to eLearn for grading.

## What are Git and GitHub?
**Git** is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work together on non-linear development histories.

**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. It provides a web-based graphical interface and helps you collaborate with other developers.

**Why are they useful in Software Engineering?**
In professional Software Engineering, these tools are essential for:
*   Tracking the history of your code (allowing you to revert to previous versions).
*   Collaborating effectively within agile teams.
*   Backing up your work securely.
*   Building a professional portfolio of your code.

## Getting Started: Setting Up Your Repository

Follow these steps to create your own repository for the course:

1.  **Sign in** to your GitHub account (or create one if you haven't).
2.  Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
3.  **Repository Name:** Enter `2603-seg2202`.
4.  **Visibility:** Select **Private**
    **(CRITICAL).:**
5.  **Initialize this repository with:**
    *   Check **Add a README file**.
    *   **Choose a license:** Select **GNU General Public License v3.0**.
6.  Click **Create repository**.

## How to Use Your Repository

You have three main options for interacting with your new repository, depending on your comfort level:

### Option 1: GitHub Website (Easiest)
You can directly upload files, edit text, and manage your code through the browser interface at github.com. This requires no local software installation.

### Option 2: GitHub Desktop (Intermediate)
Download and install the [GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/). This provides a user-friendly graphical interface on your computer to push code to GitHub without using commands.

### Option 3: Command Line (Advanced / Hacker Way)
If you want to work like a pro, learn the Git CLI (Command Line Interface). You will use commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` in your terminal. This is the most powerful and flexible way to use Git.

### Your Tasks

1.  **Customize your README:** Edit the `README.md` file in your new repo. Add a short introduction about the SEG2202 course and some information about your repository. This will help you learn Markdown syntax.
2.  **Upload Assignments:**
    *   After you have submitted your assignment work to **eLearn** during class (for grading), use this repo as a backup and portfolio.
    *   Create a new folder for each assignment (e.g., `Assignment 1`, `Assignment 2`).
    *   Upload your assignment into the respective folders in your **Private** GitHub repo.
